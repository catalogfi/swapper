---

	1. OP_IF: This opcode begins the conditional branch of the script.

	2. OP_SHA256: This opcode performs a SHA-256 hash operation.

	3. ${secretHash}: This placeholder represents the hash of a secret value. The secret is known only to the initiator of the swap and will be revealed later to claim the funds.

	4. OP_EQUALVERIFY: This opcode checks if the top two stack items are equal and verifies the result.In this case, it verifies if the provided secret hash matches the calculated hash.

	5. OP_DUP: This opcode duplicates the top stack item.

	6. OP_HASH160: This opcode performs a RIPEMD-160 hash operation.

	7. ${redeemerAddress}: This placeholder represents the Bitcoin address of the redeemer of the funds.

	8. OP_ELSE: This opcode starts the else branch of the script.

	9. ${waitTime}: This placeholder represents a time period (in blocks) until the funds can be refunded back to the initiator if the condition is not met.

	10. OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY: This opcode checks if the specified time lock (wait time) has been reached before continuing the script execution and puts the wait time back on stack.

	11. OP_DROP: This opcode removes the top stack item (wait time) since it's no longer needed.

	12. OP_DUP: This opcode duplicates the top stack item.

	13. OP_HASH160: This opcode performs a RIPEMD-160 hash operation.

	14. ${initiatorAddress}: This placeholder represents the Bitcoin address of the initiator of the funds.

	15. OP_ENDIF: This opcode marks the end of the conditional branch.

	16. OP_EQUALVERIFY: This opcode checks if the top two stack items are equal and verifies the result. In this case, it verifies if the provided address matches the calculated hash.

	17. OP_CHECKSIG: This opcode checks the signature against the public key provided in the script.

```
Note : The script execution will fail if the provided address does not match the calculated hash.
Thus it is required for the respective signers to sign the transaction with the same address that was provided in the script.

```  

- In summary, the script can be interpreted as follows:

	- If the provided secret hash matches the calculated hash, the funds are sent to the redeemer's address.

	- Otherwise, if the specified time lock is reached, the funds can be refunded back to the initiator's address.
